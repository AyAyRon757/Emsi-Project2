# Emsi-Project2
Using sqlite3 file to interact with databases in c# In my code I was unable to get it to compile, so there is no "running" the code

If you are wanting to look through the code before the interview I have written lots of comments to show you my thought process and would be more than willing to explain it to you aswell

Going into this project I was definitly in over my head and had a lot to learn, which I will explain my process during our next meeting!

The original file that was sent to me contantly opened up the web broweser whenever I ran it, so I was not able to actualy display anything to the console. Even after I set all of the "open internet = false", I still was not able to print out "hello world" to any console, meaning I had to create a new file from scratch.
